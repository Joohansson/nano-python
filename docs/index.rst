Nano (RaiBlocks) Python Library
===============================

This library contains a python wrapper for the Nano (RaiBlocks) RPC server
which tries to make it a little easier to work with by converting RPC responses
to native python ones and exposing a pythonic api for making RPC calls.

Also included are utilities such as converting rai/xrb and interesting accounts
